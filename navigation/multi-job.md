# Multi Job Menu

> The Multi Job Menu is a quick way to view the jobs that you have. You are limited to 3 jobs at a time; if you have three and attempt to get a third job it will give you an error message telling you that you have met the limit. 

## Usage

> To use the Multi Job Menu, simply press F10. From here you can choose whether you would like to appear on duty, or off duty. You can select between jobs, as well as delete jobs you no longer wish to have.
