## Features

> The inventory has been designed to produce further roleplay for you! The Body Figure on the left hand side of the inventory is functional and will show your injuries. The inventory itself is pretty self explainatory, however, for the sake of being thorough; hovering over inventory items will reveal details about the item, including how many you have, the weight of the items, and a description. This inventory system includes a decay system; over time your items will degrade until they become unavailable to use. You can see this represented by the green circles in the top right corners of inventory items. These circles will start running out, and turning from green => orange => red, until they become unusable at which point the entire item will become red.
