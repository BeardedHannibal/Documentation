# Welcome to Redux!

## Documentation

## Welcome to Redux Roleplay! To get started you will need to load FiveM and follow the instructions below:

> * Open your F8 Menu
> * Type in the following: `connect play.reduxdevelopment.org`
> * Once prompted click "Request Allowlist"

{% hint style="success" %}
Once you have completed these steps please allow the staff time to approve your request. They are typically pretty quick about this, but please allow sufficient time prior to attempting to tag them in Discord. Once your Allow List has been accepted you will be able to fly in to the server freely.
{% endhint %}



{% hint style="warning" %}
PLEASE NOTE: If you do not fly into the city for 14 days you will need to reapply for your Allow List.
