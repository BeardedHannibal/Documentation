# Racing

### Becoming a Crew Leader

To become a Racing Crew Leader, you must have at least 3 people total (Max Crew Size is 5) ready to join your crew, and then open a General Ticket in our Discord to request you be given the tools to run your crew. You will need to keep your crew active, otherwise they will be removed. Crew leaders will be the only people able to hand out racing tablets.&#x20;

When opening a ticket about becoming a crew leader, make sure that you are detailed in your ticket. You should know the name of your crew, who your members will be, what kind of cars you'll be racing, etc.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Becoming a Racer

In order to become a racer you will need to be given a Racing Tablet by a crew leader, and they will need to add you into their tablet as a racer. Each Crew Leader is responsible for the racers they bring into the racing scene. This means that if you're not active the crew leader that brought you into the scene can also remove you from the scene!&#x20;

Basically, any racer name/user created by another player will be tied to them. So if person X buys an account from player Y, player Y can also revoke player Xs account via the in game menus, as long as player Y has a user with the _control_ authorization.

### Track Creation

The key to this racing scene is to make GOOD, working tracks. There is a 10 Checkpoint minimum, and a 60 checkpoint maximum. Tracks created with more than 60 checkpoints (Unless approved by staff) will be removed from the database. This is because the more checkpoints your race contains, the more issues it will cause for the people racing; including game crashes.&#x20;

Here's a list of tips and tricks while creating your races:

* Avoid placing checkpoints on/under/near bridges/overpasses.
* Base GTA GPS can't handle opposite-directions on roads. Place checkpoints on the correct side of the road.
* Intersections can be problematic for the GPS. Do not place checkpoints in the middle of intersections; instead place them before, or after the intersection in the correct lane.
* Alleyways can cause problems. Use with caution.
* This racing script fires 2 entities and 1 emitter per checkpoint. Having too many checkpoints may crash some people's games. If you're caught doing this on purpose you will be permanently banned from the server.

### Track Curation

Our idea with the curation of tacks is to allow admins to flag a track as "Acceptable". After the track has been curated, it can no longer be edited. If you have a track that has been Curated by an admin, and you wish to edit it, you must open a ticket for approval, first.
