# Fishing Documentation

> Looking to spend the day on the water and go fishing?! Sounds like a nice relaxing time to me, my friend. Below you'll be able to find instructions on how to get started.

## Getting Started

- Head to SeaTrade Corp. on the beach near 8005 to buy gear
- Head to any major body of water and use your fishing pole. 
- Or visit the boat rental ped on the beach to get a boat to head out to the fishing spots in the deeper water
- Sell your fish at SeaTrade Corp. near 8005 when you're done.

> You can fish anywhere you like, it doesn't need to be in the fishing zones in the ocean. Each Fishing zone will offer different kinds of fish, though.
